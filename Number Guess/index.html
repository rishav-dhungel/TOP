    <h2>Number Guessing Game Description:</h2>
    <p>This is a simple interactive game where the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100), and the player tries to guess it. The game provides feedback after each guess to guide the player:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="warn-high">If the guess is too high, the game will notify the player that the number is lower.</li>
      <li class="warn-low">If the guess is too low, the game will notify the player that the number is higher.</li>
      <li class="warn-correct">If the guess is correct, the game congratulates the player and shows the number of attempts taken.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number. It also keeps track of the number of attempts and can optionally allow the player to restart for a new random number.</p>
